# Images Directory

This directory will store all website images. For now, please add the following images:

1. `automation-illustration.png` - A visual representation of workflow automation for the hero section
2. `tech-icon-placeholder.png` - Simple icons for the technology stack section
3. `founder-image.jpg` - Professional photo of Odunayo Rotimi

When adding these images, please ensure they are optimized for web (compressed without losing quality) and follow the recommended dimensions:

- Hero illustration: 800px × 600px
- Tech icons: 100px × 100px
- Founder image: 500px × 600px

The website is designed to work with placeholder images until these actual images are added.
